# Testing and reproducibility

Use Node 24 and PostgreSQL 16. Start from `npm ci`, configure `.env.local`, and run `npm run verify`. That command includes a production build and the test migrations. `npx playwright install chromium` is needed once per machine; Linux may need `--with-deps`.

| Command | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint with zero warnings allowed |
| `npm run typecheck` | Strict TypeScript |
| `npm test` | Credential/name validation, salts, password verification, corrupt hashes, tokens |
| `npm run db:migrate:test` | Ordered migrations against the isolated test database |
| `npm run test:integration` | Real PostgreSQL sessions, ownership, constraints, rate limits, and server actions |
| `npm run build` | Next.js production compilation and route generation |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Actual Chromium and production server: account lifecycle, cookies, expiry, existing portfolio persistence |

## Test isolation

`scripts/test.mjs` requires `TEST_DATABASE_URL` ending in `_test` and passes it as the child's `DATABASE_URL`. Playwright also checks they match. It starts a new server at `http://localhost:3100`, with `APP_ORIGIN` set to that address, and refuses to reuse another server. Tests cannot silently hit development/staging through the ordinary script commands.

Fixtures use unique generated account addresses, clean up only their own rows, and close database connections. No production table truncation, shared global counter, or hard-coded account credentials are needed. Retrying tests is not used to hide failures. Browser traces are disabled to avoid recording credentials; the HTML report retains names, outcomes, and sanitized assertion failures.

## Security evidence boundaries

Integration tests use the real PostgreSQL driver and SQL, including real password hashing. Only Next.js request adapters (cookies, headers, redirect, cache revalidation) are mocked so server actions can be invoked directly. Playwright verifies those adapters in a real application server. Neither layer substitutes mocked data for database authorization.

Current financial/API tests do not exist because those features are not implemented. Staging smoke checks must be recorded separately from local tests. See [Issue 1 evidence](issue-1-evidence.md) for actual results and identified corrections.
